# Stack to Slack

This [Slack](https://slack.com/) bot monitors [StackExchange](https://stackexchange.com/) tags and automatically
publishes new questions in configured Slack channels.

It has been initially created to post all questions related to the [API Platform](https://api-platform.com) framework
in a dedicated channel of the Slack of [Les-Tilleuls.coop](https://les-tilleuls.coop) (the company behind the framework).
